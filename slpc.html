                  <p>Actually, it feels wrong to even address you as such.</p>
                  <p>Good evening members of the community</p>
                  <p>As you all should probably know by now, our questions have been answered and I guess our biggest fear has been confirmed - The end is near, and being fully funded and ushered by the SLPC and Swinlympia.</p>
                  <p>I, for one, speak for the rest of us here at The Daily Burne when I tell you that we had no idea, no inkling, about what was happening behind the scenes. When we ran our cover piece at the start of this year's games about the return of Swinlympia, we prepared ourselves for some controversy with the SLPC heading the events, but never at this kind of magnitude.</p>
                  <p>During this week's PreySeeker event, Swinlympia Champion David Yang was seen talking with one Mr. Slater, a representative sent down from the governing body of Suot City. They seemed to have a pleasant discussion, given the situation at hand with Mr. X roaming around campus.</p>
                  <p>When asked about the conversation, David had this in response.</p>
                  <p>	‘He (Mr. Slater) was just concerned about Mr. X’s involvement in the games, and so am I. The end is rapidly approaching and we are trying our hardest to provide enjoyable games. You all understand the importance of these games, and anyone trying to help Mr. X is only momentarily slowing the inevitable.’</p>
                  <p>David had no further response when asked about his current status with the SLPC.</p>
                  <p>For the time that we have left, all of us here at The Daily Burne will still be covering the remainder of the games.</p>
                  <p>Good luck to those fighting for their survival, and may we remain ever hopeful that this… might all just be some sick dream.</p>

                  <p>Greetings… combatants.</p>
                  <p>I just thought I’d take some time out of my already busy schedule to address the elephant in the room. Are we, the SLPC, using the Swinlympia as a front for a eugenics program, in order to populate our new world with the best possible specimens?</p>
                  <p>Eh, we are. The time for beating around the bush is over.</p>
                  <p>Swinlympia has a long standing tradition of awarding the best competitors with esteem and recognition, but for too long has the world been in need of a makeover. Our earthly resources are depleting every second, and are being used by those who are unworthy, those who have no value and produce nothing for society.</p>
                  <p>Is what we’re doing wrong? No!</p>
                  <p>We are trying to help you, and that is what that fool Mr. X just doesn’t understand. The Swinlympia is your vessel, WE ARE GIVING YOU A CHANCE TO JOIN US.</p>
                  <p>The games are pushing forward. There are no other options. Thrive to Survive, otherwise…</p>

                  <!-- Post Content -->
                  <p class="lead">Greetings competitors,</p>
                  <p>This week’s Swinlympia double feature left more questions than answers as the competitors were left speechless by the appearance of Mr. X, who made his presence felt, disrupting the games and costing the SLPC a victory in Corridor Sprint. Damien will touch on the games in his blog later, but what I’m left asking is - Is Mr. X right? Is this Swinlympia the last of long line of tradition, and are they ushering in the so called ‘New World’?</p>
                  <p>Champion David Yang didn’t leave much to the imagination when he had to address Mr. X’s interruptions live on commentary, often spouting out ‘This means nothing X man! You aren’t worthy!’</p>
                  <p>After the Corridor Sprint event, one of the competitor’s recalls overhearing a conversation between Gamemaster Aidan and Champion Yang as they discuss the SLPC loss.</p>
                  <p>     ‘That Gamemaster guy said something along the lines of “It’s just one loss, David. There’s nothing to worry about” and then I distinctly remember hearing David say “If our own chosen competitors can’t win a simple game, then what makes them worthy, Aidan? Thrive to Survive, if they can’t beat that X man, then they can die with the rest of them!”’</p>
                  <p>‘Thrive to Survive’... If Mr. X is right, then winning these games is more than just about glory.</p>
                  <p>It’s about our very survival…</p>

                  <p class="lead">Greetings competitors, I’m Felicity Boveheart, coming to you live from the post radio press conference, second floor of The George building.</p>
                  <p>4:04pm - After sitting down with the ‘An Outrage’ presenter, Peter Matthews, David has taken the podium, ready to answer our questions.</p>
                  <p>4:08pm - A question from Twitter comes in, ‘Mr. Champ, how do you feel about Mr. X? His attacks seem more persistent’ - @SarahYeon8</p>
      	          <p>‘I try to pay as little attention as possible when it comes to the neigh sayers, for they demand very little. I ask, once again, where is the proof? Swinlympia has been a consistent Swinburne institution for the last decade, and it will continue to be for the decades following.’</p>
                  <p>4:15pm - ‘Good afternoon Champ, Daniel O’Neil, Sports reporter and editor for The Daily Burne. We spoke briefly on Monday at the Wasp’s Nest event, I was just wanting to get some word on next Monday's events, what should we be expecting?’</p>
                  <p>	‘Daniel, looking sharp as always. Well next Monday, we will be running a double feature - Blackout and Corridor Sprint - as well as discus, campus relay, and over to the Aquatic Center for the swimming portions of the Swinlympia. What should you be expecting? Well what I’m expecting is hopefully a more dominant performance from the SLPC representatives. I think the spectacle around this Patrick Lunney was just a once off, but we’ll see… anything can happen in these games, Dan.’</p>
                  <p>4:21pm - The press conference is cut short after a man wearing a suit covering a black morph suit jumps up and shouts at David, calling him out for his deceit.</p>
                  <p>4:22pm - The FASG logo appears onto the projector, and a soundbite from a telephone call between David and Harold plays in the background. David rushes out with the belt, tailed by his security staff.</p>
                  <p>I don’t believe what I just heard. If this is true, then… I don’t know.</p>

                  <p class="lead">Greetings competitors,</p>
                  <p>Congratulations to all those who made it out to the opening games of the Swinlympia yesterday afternoon. A solid attendance overall across all events, with Wasp’s Nest drawing the most attention.</p>
                  <p>Blue Team, lead by Patrick Lunney’s historic performance, put on a clinic as they tore apart the competition, blowing Green Team (lead by SLPC’s very best) out 17 to 11.</p>
                  <p>The story of the day is walk on sensation, Patrick Lunney. No prior Swinlympia record, his first time performance was one for the history books as he sets a Wasp’s Nest individual scoring record of 13 points, a record previously held by none other than current Swinlympia Champion, David Yang.</p>
                  <p>When interviewed by our very own Damienl O’Neil, David had this to say to the new record holder.</p>
                  <p>‘He’s definitely exciting. There were a few spots throughout the game where he would stare me down before scoring, and I just though ‘Kid, if i was still able to compete, i’d make you eat your words’. It’s like you said, Dam, he’s a rookie and I’ve never seen him before in my life. From rags to riches. I’m excited for how he holds up during some of the more communication based games.’</p>
                  <p>Lunney denied our request for a post game interview, and went on to ask for the footage to be removed.</p>
                  <p>Indeed, strange behaviour from a potential Swinlympia All-Time Great. Tune in next Monday the 16th as Swinlympia hosts Blackout & Corridor Sprint!</p>

                  <p class="lead">Greetings competitors,</p>
                  <p>We are mere days away from the first events of the 2016 Swinlympia, taking place next monday the 9th of May, kicking things off with Wasp’s Nest in the Central Gardens.</p>
                  <p>Making waves this week however are the potential sightings of the notorious ‘Mr. X’ figure seen around Suot City. As we know, the FASG and their propaganda has been prevalent around Suot City, their posters appearing often alongside the SLPC’s promotion of the Swinlympia events.</p>
                  <p>But alongside this, a man dressed in a black morph suit has been seen around Suot City, particularly outside of The George, spreading rumours that ‘the end of the world is near.’</p>
                  <p>Swinlympia Champion, David Yang, at this time has no comment on the Mr. X sightings, and has expressed in earlier interviews that he and the SLPC are ‘dealing with the matter personally.’ assuring the community that they need not worry.</p>
                  <p>Well, we are beginning to worry, as the Mr. X sightings continue to grow, as well as the FASG fanbase. As things begin to pick up, I urge you to stay cautious competitors.</p>
                  <p>Games begin Monday the 9th.</p>

                  <p>Following yesterdays official Swinlympia Press Conference, the games are now in full swing.</p>
                  <p>Champion Yang, as well as other promoters from the SLPC will be around Suot City over the following weeks to help further promote the events. Be wary though, as during the press conference, an altercation broke out between Mr Yang and a riled up aggressor in the crowd.</p>
                  <p>An eyewitness, who wished to remain anonymous, stated that ‘He just got up and preached that this whole Swinlympia ordeal was a lie. Some sort of eugenics thing, I think I heard him say. Such gibberish, he must be crazy, he even tried to take a swing at the Champion’.<p>
                  <p>We were unable to receive any comments from the attacker at this time. His whereabouts remain unknown.</p>
                  <p>Without any facts, all I can say is that this pure bile is nonsense, but we here at The Daily Burne pride ourselves on reporting an unbiased story for we fight for the truth.</p>
                  <br>
                  <p>Stay tuned, as this seasons Swinlympia is about to begin, and the stakes couldn’t be any higher!</p>

                  <p>Greetings competitors,</p>
                  <p>Last week, Harold Swine - Chairman of the SLPC - opened up the 2016 year by announcing the return of the Swinlympia, now under SLPC promotion. The press conference showered much awe over the Swinburne community as this year’s games will be heralded as the beginning of ‘The New Era’, establishing an open call out to all members of the community to compete in the Swinlympia.</p>
                  <p>However, last night, current Swinlympia Champion - David Yang - broke his silence on the matter and announced that he too will be returning to Swinburne and will serve as lead promoter for the events, as well appear on commentary. Yang tweeted, ‘Of course i’m back, did you really doubt it? #TheChampIsHere shoutout to @JohnCena’</p>

                <p>After the enormous success of the 2015 season, the Swinlympia is back again this year under a new promoter - The Swinburne Life Preservation Committee, chaired by none other than Swinburne alumni, Harold Swine.</p>
                <p>The SLPC hopes to further build upon the Swinlympia’s motto of ‘Health, physique, and mind. Conquer the games, Conquer yourselves!’ by crowning this years champion as the face of the ‘New Era’, as Mr Swine put it during the SLPC press conference earlier this year.</p>
                <p>‘I started this committee to breed unity within the university. Swinlympia’s stature and appeal is cornerstone to what I believe Swinburne is about - the preservation of life, not just physical, but mentally as well. It truly is a testament to Swinlympia’s team for designing events that can be played by all walks of life.’ Mr Swine said during his opening remarks at the SLPC press conference.</p>
