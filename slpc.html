                  <p class="lead">Greetings competitors,</p>
                  <p>Congratulations to all those who made it out to the opening games of the Swinlympia yesterday afternoon. A solid attendance overall across all events, with Wasp’s Nest drawing the most attention.</p>
                  <p>Blue Team, lead by Patrick Lunney’s historic performance, put on a clinic as they tore apart the competition, blowing Green Team (lead by SLPC’s very best) out 17 to 11.</p>
                  <p>The story of the day is walk on sensation, Patrick Lunney. No prior Swinlympia record, his first time performance was one for the history books as he sets a Wasp’s Nest individual scoring record of 13 points, a record previously held by none other than current Swinlympia Champion, David Yang.</p>
                  <p>When interviewed by our very own Damienl O’Neil, David had this to say to the new record holder.</p>
                  <p>‘He’s definitely exciting. There were a few spots throughout the game where he would stare me down before scoring, and I just though ‘Kid, if i was still able to compete, i’d make you eat your words’. It’s like you said, Dam, he’s a rookie and I’ve never seen him before in my life. From rags to riches. I’m excited for how he holds up during some of the more communication based games.’</p>
                  <p>Lunney denied our request for a post game interview, and went on to ask for the footage to be removed.</p>
                  <p>Indeed, strange behaviour from a potential Swinlympia All-Time Great. Tune in next Monday the 16th as Swinlympia hosts Blackout & Corridor Sprint!</p>

                  <p class="lead">Greetings competitors,</p>
                  <p>We are mere days away from the first events of the 2016 Swinlympia, taking place next monday the 9th of May, kicking things off with Wasp’s Nest in the Central Gardens.</p>
                  <p>Making waves this week however are the potential sightings of the notorious ‘Mr. X’ figure seen around campus. As we know, the FASG and their propaganda has been prevalent around the Swinburne campus, their posters appearing often alongside the SLPC’s promotion of the Swinlympia events.</p>
                  <p>But alongside this, a man dressed in a black morph suit has been seen around campus, particularly outside of The George, spreading rumours that ‘the end of the world is near.’</p>
                  <p>Swinlympia Champion, David Yang, at this time has no comment on the Mr. X sightings, and has expressed in earlier interviews that he and the SLPC are ‘dealing with the matter personally.’ assuring the community that they need not worry.</p>
                  <p>Well, we are beginning to worry, as the Mr. X sightings continue to grow, as well as the FASG fanbase. As things begin to pick up, I urge you to stay cautious competitors.</p>
                  <p>Games begin Monday the 9th.</p>

                  <p class="lead">Greetings competitors,</p>
                  <p>Following yesterdays official Swinlympia Press Conference, the games are now in full swing.</p>
                  <p>Champion Yang, as well as other promoters from the SLPC will be around campus over the following weeks to help further promote the events. Be wary though, as during the press conference, an altercation broke out between Mr Yang and a riled up aggressor in the crowd.</p>
                  <p>An eyewitness, who wished to remain anonymous, stated that ‘He just got up and preached that this whole Swinlympia ordeal was a lie. Some sort of eugenics thing, I think I heard him say. Such gibberish, he must be crazy, he even tried to take a swing at the Champion’.<p>
                  <p>We were unable to receive any comments from the attacker at this time. His whereabouts remain unknown.</p>
                  <p>Without any facts, all I can say is that this pure bile is nonsense, but we here at The Daily Burne pride ourselves on reporting an unbiased story for we fight for the truth.</p>
                  <br>
                  <p>Stay tuned, as this seasons Swinlympia is about to begin, and the stakes couldn’t be any higher!</p>

                  <p>Greetings competitors,</p>
                  <p>Last week, Harold Swine - Chairman of the SLPC - opened up the 2016 year by announcing the return of the Swinlympia, now under SLPC promotion. The press conference showered much awe over the Swinburne community as this year’s games will be heralded as the beginning of ‘The New Era’, establishing an open call out to all members of the community to compete in the Swinlympia.</p>
                  <p>However, last night, current Swinlympia Champion - David Yang - broke his silence on the matter and announced that he too will be returning to Swinburne and will serve as lead promoter for the events, as well appear on commentary. Yang tweeted, ‘Of course i’m back, did you really doubt it? #TheChampIsHere shoutout to @JohnCena’</p>

                <p class="lead">Greetings competitors, and welcome back to another season of the Swinlympia!</p>
                <p>After the enormous success of the 2015 season, the Swinlympia is back again this year under a new promoter - The Swinburne Life Preservation Committee, chaired by none other than Swinburne alumni, Harold Swine.</p>
                <p>The SLPC hopes to further build upon the Swinlympia’s motto of ‘Health, physique, and mind. Conquer the games, Conquer yourselves!’ by crowning this years champion as the face of the ‘New Era’, as Mr Swine put it during the SLPC press conference earlier this year.</p>
                <p>‘I started this committee to breed unity within the university. Swinlympia’s stature and appeal is cornerstone to what I believe Swinburne is about - the preservation of life, not just physical, but mentally as well. It truly is a testament to Swinlympia’s team for designing events that can be played by all walks of life.’ Mr Swine said during his opening remarks at the SLPC press conference.</p>
