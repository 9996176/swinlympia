          <h2>What We Do</h2>
          <p>Here at the SLPC, it is our mission to let the human race be the best it can be. We want to preserve and grow the best parts of humanity.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col">
          <h2>Who We Are</h2>
          <p>Lead by Harold Swine - former student and renown pro-life activist, and backed by other esteemed board members, the Swinburne Life Preservation Committee is run by experts in their respective areas. Although we are a relatively new organisation, we're dedicated to achieving our goals, no matter the size.
        </div>
        <div class="col">
          <h2>Harold Swine</h2>
          <p>Former student and renown Pro-life activist Harold Swine was the perfect choice to the chair the new committee. He studied health sciences and wrote his PH.D thesis on the physical tolls the Olympics play on an athlete's body - pre and post competition.</p>
          <p>Born in Melbourne Australia, he’s always been vocal on the physical attributes Australians have, and often compares their genetics to those of the best athletes in the world.</p>

          <h2>David Yang</h2>
          <p><em>Age: 21</em></p>
          <p><em>Occupation: Student</em></p>

          <p>The former Swinlympia Champion of the 2015 season comes back to join the SLPC in their endeavours of promoting the event for the 2016 season.</p>
          <p>David has a close relationship with the committee leader, Harold Swine, and has on occasion has expressed his admiration for his views and morals.</p>
          <p>Upon learning about the SLPC’s true motives for the 2016 Swinlympia, David reluctantly sided with Harold Swine, understanding the need for a new world.</p>
          <p>Primarily used to market the event, as well as serve as colour commentary during the events, Davids character is morphed around the dystopian agenda and is obliviously to the FASG’s advances.
          Hot headed, eccentric, and charismatic, David has all the likeable tools that the SLPC wants to build their campaign around.
          An extremely coherent understanding of the events, his knowledge is invaluable to the SLPC as they begin to initiate their eugenics program.</p>
